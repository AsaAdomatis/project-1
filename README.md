# Running Up the Score: NFL Running Back Salary Forecasting
Running Up the Score is a set a visualizations for Project 1 for the EdX AI Bootcamp 2024.
## Project Overview
### Description
Through the synthesis and analysis of several datasets encompassing NFL player position, salary, years of experience, and other player and career details, we will attempt to visualize the correlation between several of these factors, most specifically the significance of running back as a position and whether they typically function as an outlier compared to other positions. Within running back data specifically, we will be looking at correlations between years of experience and salary (which can be compared with a visualization of how years of experience affect salary), production (career rushing yard totals) and salary, etc.
### GQ - What are the critical factors that most effectively determine running back cap hit?
- How does age affect cap hit?
- How does position affect cap hit? 
- How does a runningback's touchdowns affect cap hit?
- How does average rush attempts affect cap hit?
- How does total rush yards affect cap hit for runningbacks?
- How do awards affect cap hit?
## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pandas, requests, matplot, scipy, and prophet. Alternatively, you can use this [CoLab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13hsjrGripvLE8_Y0ZHztOG3AET5U0Fp3) to run the code in browser.
#### Pandas
```bash
pip install pandas
```
#### Requests
```bash
pip install requests
```
#### Matplot
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
#### Scipy
```bash
pip install scipy
```
#### Prophet
```bash
pip install prophet
```
### Cleaning Code
The notebooks in cleaning code where used to produce some of .csv's for used by combining databases, however they are not needed to run the code, as the .csv's are stored throughout the project to be used raw.
