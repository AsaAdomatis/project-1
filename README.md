## Project Overview
### GQ - What are the critical factors that most effectively determine running back cap hit?
- How does age affect cap hit?
- How does position affect cap hit? 
- How does a runningback's touchdowns affect cap hit?
- How does average rush attempts affect cap hit?
- How does total rush yards affect cap hit for runningbacks?
- How do awards affect cap hit?
### Description
Through the synthesis and analysis of several datasets encompassing NFL player position, salary, years of experience, and other player and career details, we will attempt to visualize the correlation between several of these factors, most specifically the significance of running back as a position and whether they typically function as an outlier compared to other positions. Within running back data specifically, we will be looking at correlations between years of experience and salary (which can be compared with a visualization of how years of experience affect salary), production (career rushing yard totals) and salary, etc.
